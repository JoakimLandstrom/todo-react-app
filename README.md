This is an example of a simple to do list app written in React.
You can structure your app however you like but try to include all the basic requirements below. 
We have given some suggestions for additional features to do if you want and have time but these are optional :smiley:


# Installation
Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
Install the dependencies and start the local server.

```sh
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
The page will reload automatically if you make edits.


To run tests:

```sh
$ npm test
```
##### You can now start building your first React component in ```app.js``` :thumbsup:

# Basic requirements of the app:
  - Add a new todo to your todo-list
  - Edit a todo
  - Remove a todo from the list
  - Mark a todo as "done"

# Optional extra features:
  - Use Redux as your state container
  - Filter todos by status
  - Set a due date for a todo
  - Create todo categories
  - Write further tests in ```app.test.js```
 - ....and more!
