This is an example of a simple to do list app written in React.<br>
You can structure your app however you like but try to include all the basic requirements below. <br>
We have given some suggestions for additional features to do if you want and have time but these are optional :smiley:

# Installation :wrench:
Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Start with forking this repository from the menu above :point_up:

Then make a local clone:

```sh
$ git clone ssh://git@git.is.comhem.com:7999/{insert-your-gitlab-user-name}/todo-react-app.git
$ cd todo-react-app

```

Install the dependencies and start the local server:


```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
<br>
The page will reload automatically if you make edits.


To run tests:

```sh
$ npm test
```
##### You can now start building your first React component in ```app.js``` :thumbsup:
